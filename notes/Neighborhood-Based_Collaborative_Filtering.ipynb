This means that vectors [1, 1, 1, 1] (let's call it A) and [500, 500, 500, 500] (let's call it B) will have an angle of 0 despite having different magnitudes. Pearson correlation checks for a linear relationship between two datasets (in this case vectors A and vectors B are considered different distributions rather than a single). For example, if an increase in a variable in dataset a also leads to an increase in its corresponding item in dataset b, that can be considered to be a positive correlation. This concept of correlation can then be transferred to check the similarity between two vectors. Since Pearson correlation can be used to check for the relationship between two vectors, it is more discriminative compared to cosine similarity.\n",
